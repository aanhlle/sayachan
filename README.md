# sayachan ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ
A small Discord bot to learn Japanese vocabulary.

Saya is built using [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)

## What Sayachan does
Saya will spread the vocabulary in the vocab list folder and send them randomly to your server channel at customized intervals.

## How to use?
Just fork the source and deploy it to your server (via Heroku or similar deployment services)

## Commands
`!ping` to see Saya's welcome message and status.

`!kotoba mimi start` to start the vocab spreader (the default vocabulary list is Mimikara Oboeru N1).

`!kotoba mimi stop` to stop.

When a command stops working you can type `!reload` to clear Discord cache and reload the command.

Type `!help` to see Saya's full commands.
